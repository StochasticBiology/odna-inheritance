Questions:

* why evolve a finite bottleneck size?
* why evolve finite leakage?
* why evolve DUI?
* what's the best strategy for a given mutation rate (hazard) and environmental challenge?
* connections with Zwonitzer?
* connections with other taxa (bivalves, protists, fungi, ...?)
* paternal/maternal differences unresolved at this level
